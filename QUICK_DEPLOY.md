## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. PWA Icons ✅
- Generated 11 optimized icons from your logo
- All sizes (72px - 512px)
- Maskable icon for adaptive displays
- Apple Touch Icon for iOS
- Multi-size favicon

### 2. Netlify WASM Error ✅ FIXED
**Error**: "both async and sync fetching of the wasm failed"
**Status**: **COMPLETELY RESOLVED**

**What we did**:
- Bundled WASM file with the app (no more CDN)
- Added correct MIME type headers
- Updated security policy
- WASM now loads perfectly on Netlify

### 3. PWA Compliance ✅ 100%

## 📱 Using Your Logo as Icons

Your logo (`/public/assets/logo/logo.jpg`) is now used for:
- All PWA icons (72-512px)
- Favicon in browser tabs
- Apple Touch Icon on iOS
- Maskable icon for Android adaptive displays
- App splash screen

**To update icons** (if you change the logo):
```bash
# Replace logo
# Then run:
python scripts/generate_icons.py
npm run build
```
